# Debiasing targeted testing data

This repository contains the R scripts needed to reproduce the results reported 
in the manuscript 'Improving local prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections using a causal debiasing framework'. 

## Installation

To run these scripts, you will need R version 3.6.3 or later, widely available on 
Unix-like, Windows and Mac families of operating systems. If you have R version 4.0.0
or above on Windows, you will also need to install 
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). The demo below has
been tested on macOS 10.15 Catalina, Windows 10 and CentOS Linux 7. To get started,
first [clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)
this repository onto your local machine. Next, open an R console, and install the 
[renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) R package if you don't have it 
already (e.g. via `install.packages("renv")`). Then, run the following, 
changing `path_to_dir` to the path of your local version of this repository,
```
path_to_dir <- "path/to/jbc-turing-rss-testdebiasing"
setwd(path_to_dir)
renv::activate(path_to_dir)
renv::restore(path_to_dir)
# 3 minutes, 10 seconds
```
to install the required packages for the scripts. 

## Demo

The repository includes a subset of the data for the lower-tier local authority 
of Adur and its corresponding PHE region of the South East. To load the data and
the `prevdebiasr` package:

```
base::load("data/example.RData")
library(prevdebiasr)
```

This loads two data frames: `southeast_df` containing weekly Pillar 1+2 testing 
data and REACT study data for the whole of the South East, and `adur_df` 
containing weekly Pillar 1+2 data for Adur, from the end of May 2020 to the
beginning of August 2021. The columns `nt` and `Nt` contain the number of
of positive and total Pillar 1+2 tests respectively, while the columns `nr` and 
`Nr` contain the corresponding number of REACT tests. The column `M` contains 
the population of the relevant region.  
  
To generate estimates for &delta; for the South East, i.e. the log odds ratio 
of being tested in the infected versus the non-infected subpopulations: 

```
control_debias <- get_control_parameters(alpha_testing = 3e-4)
delta_df <- specify_delta_prior(southeast_df, control_debias)
# 2 minutes, 28 seconds
```

The `get_control_parameters()` function is a utility to set the hyperparameters 
of the statistical model. See the manuscript and `?get_control_parameters` for 
more details. The output `delta_df` is a data frame with two columns: 
`delta_prior_mean` and `delta_prior_sd` contain the mean and standard deviation 
of a moment-matched Gaussian approximation for &delta;, to be used downstream 
in estimating debiased prevalence.

```
head(delta_df)
#   delta_prior_mean delta_prior_sd
# 1         2.888957      0.3226672
# 2         2.881859      0.3045518
# 3         2.875330      0.2829014
# 4         2.869367      0.2568006
# 5         2.895197      0.2599046
# 6         2.878135      0.2641643
```


To obtain estimates of debiased prevalence for Adur:
```
adur_df <- cbind(adur_df, delta_df)
adur_prevalence <- local_prevalence(adur_df, control_debias)
# 1 minute, 33 seconds
```
The output `adur_prevalence` is a list containing three matrices: `log_post`, 
`norm_post` and `log_lik` corresponding to the log posterior, the normalised
posterior, and the log likelihood for debiased prevalence. Each matrix is of 
dimension 'number of weeks' x 'number of prevalence bins'. The prevalence bins 
used can be found in `control_debias$bin.d`.

```
adur_prevalence$norm_post[1:3, 30:32]
#             45           48           51
# 1 0.0188419722 0.0231530560 0.0266946627
# 2 0.0002964074 0.0002060873 0.0001500834
# 3 0.0483394905 0.0429635767 0.0402508229
```


## Scripts to reproduce manuscript results

To subdirectory `scripts` contains all the code needed to reproduce the results 
in the manuscript. On a CentOS Linux 7 computing cluster using 24 CPUs, running 
all the scripts took approximately 16 hours.

`00_download_data.R`  fetches the required data.  
`01_preprocess_data.R`  performs some initial preprocessing of the data for downstream use.  
`02_calculate_infectiousness_estimates` computes the time-dependent probability of being infectiousness conditional on returning a (true) positive PCR test  
`03_prevalence_comparisons.R` calculates prevalence estimates and credible intervals using 1) only Pillar 1+2 data and 2) only REACT data.  
`04a_main_run.R` contains the analysis scripts to generate the results in the main part of the manuscript. 
`04b_main_cut.R` contains the analysis scripts to generate the results for Validation 2. 
`05_supp_run.R` contains the analysis scripts to generate the results for the supplementary material.  
`06*.R` contains the plotting scripts to generate the figures in the main part of the manuscript.  
`07*.R` contains the plotting scripts to generate the figures in the supplementary material.  

`create_SIR_transition_matrices.R` precalculates the hidden Markov model transition matrices in transmats/ needed to fit the stochastic epidemic model.  


### Notes

The scripts to generate the map plots in `06f_delta_variant.R` requires the 
additional R packages "sf" and "rgdal". They are not installed here by default 
due to their large number of dependencies.

The script to generate SI Figure 15 uses python. To install the relevant dependencies 
via a conda environment, run `conda env create -f testdebiasing.yml`.
